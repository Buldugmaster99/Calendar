Code: 5e928h
    src/logic/Config
    Config Files missing <Exception>

    config.json file missing
    must be there and contain all constants,
    or anywhere in program errors will occur

    Normally this doesn't happen, because a file
    with default values is generated at program startup
    if this file is missing

Code: j21ka1
    src/logic/Config
    Missing Config option: <Option>

    configuration was not defined in config.json file
    either it got changed by some 5Head or I forgot
    to add the option to the default configuration
    values that are filled if the file is missing


Code: k23d1f
    src/logic/Config
    Invalid Config value: <Option> requested Type: <Type>  value Type: <Type>

    configuration could not be cast to Type requested
    from getConfig<Type>() function

    <Description>

    unknown Key was found in conf.json
    all keys most be defined in Configs Enum


Code: ik49dk
    src/logic/Config
    Invalid Config value: <Option> requested Type: <Type>  value Type: <Type>
